Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price. Bollinger bands help determine whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. They are used in pairs, both upper and lower bands and in conjunction with a moving average.When the bands tighten during a period of low volatility, it raises the likelihood of a sharp price move in either direction. This may begin a trending move. Watch out for a false move in opposite direction which reverses before the proper trend begins.\nWhen the bands separate by an unusual large amount, volatility increases and any existing trend may be ending. A strong trend continuation can be expected when the price moves out of the bands. However, if prices move immediately back inside the band, then the suggested strength is negated.")

The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. The EMA is a moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. Like all moving averages, this technical indicator is used to produce buy and sell signals based on crossovers and divergences from the historical average. Investors tend to interpret a rising EMA as a support to price action and a falling EMA as a resistance. With that interpretation, investors look to buy when the price is near the rising EMA and sell when the price is near the falling EMA.")

A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
